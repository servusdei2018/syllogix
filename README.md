# syllogix - agentic syllogistic reasoning

This framework facilitates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to "think" using a verifiable, step-by-step logical process. Instead of producing a single, black-box answer, it generates an auditable train of thought that validates each conclusion against demonstrably sound deductive and inductive logic. The final output is not just an answer, but a "proof" of how that answer was reached.
